# Rust Hour Calc
A schedule hour calculator written in Rust that tells you how many hours you work this week and calculates the final paycheck amount.
Made as a small project to practice Rust.

Run example:
`cargo run 4-cl 5-8 2-cl 9-cl 11-8 8.5'
Where cl means closing (10 in this example) and 8.5 is the hourly wage.
